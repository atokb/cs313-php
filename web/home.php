          <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I started studying Web Development after I enrolled in BYU-Idaho's online program; which was made possible through BYU-Pathway<br>
            My interest in the web came as a result of my desire to pursue a degree that would allow me work remotely, without having to be Software Development related.<br>
            In Ghana; where I come from, many people love using technology, but most people gear towards software or computer science, because of the current demand.<br>
            I therefore saw the web as an option which would be a future benefit; since it's possibilities such as web apps, e-commerce, API's etc, has not really been explored in Ghana.<br>
            Listening to music, dancing, playing soccer, running, singing, and exploring new things are some of the things I love to do, when I get some time away from coding.
